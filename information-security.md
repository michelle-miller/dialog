## Deleting data in Dialog
{: #gdpr-dialog}

Do not add personal data to the training data (entities and intents, including user examples) that you create.

If you need to remove a customer's message data from a Dialog service instance, create a support ticket to request the deletion.

### Deleting data
To request the deletion of data that was added to the service by a specific user, create a support request. Go to [IBM Cloud service support ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://watson.service-now.com/wcp), and then enter a ticket to request the data deletion.

If you know the `client_id` that was passed with POST requests sent to the `/conversation` endpoint, the `conversation_id`, or the time frame in which conversations were created by this user, add the information to the ticket.

To take advantage of feature enhancements, including the ability to delete message data associated with specific customer IDs yourself, consider upgrading to the [{{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/conversation/index.html).
